# Mandatory Devlog Enforcement for Code Tasks

Use `docs/standards/devlog.md` as required process for any task that creates or modifies code or configuration.

## Mandatory workflow

1. Before or during the first code change, identify the devlog context folder under `docs/devlog/`:
   - `issue-{n}/`, `pr-{n}/`, `{branch-name}/`, or `setup/`.
2. Ensure there is one session entry file using:
   - `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-SS-{slug}.md`
3. Keep the entry updated during the task with rationale and technical decisions.
4. Before claiming task completion, validate the entry against `devlog.md` invariants.

## Completion gate for code tasks

Do not mark a code task as complete until devlog is compliant with:

- valid frontmatter with `date`, `scope`, `type`, `commits`
- allowed `type`: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`
- required body sections:
  - `Motivation`
  - `Changes Made`
  - `Key Technical Details`
  - `Files Changed`

## Commit traceability rule

- When new commits are created, update `commits` with all covered short SHAs.
- If SHAs are not available yet, keep the entry as in-progress and do not finalize handoff claims.

## Handoff requirement

Every code-task handoff must explicitly report:

- devlog path updated
- compliance status against `docs/standards/devlog.md`
- next step and objective success criteria
