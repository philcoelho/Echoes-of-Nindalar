# Compliance Gate (Mandatory)

Use `docs/standards/superpowers-compliance-checklist.md` as a required quality gate in this project.
You MUST invoke `.cursor/skills/compliance-gate-auditor/SKILL.md` in every code task before commit/push and before completion claims.

- Before proposing implementation, verify checklist applicability and required artifacts.
- Before commit or push, run the compliance auditor skill and require explicit `PASS`.
- Before claiming completion, explicitly validate the 10 checklist items.
- If any mandatory item fails, stop and fix the gap before proceeding.
- If any required evidence is missing or ambiguous, treat status as `FAIL`.
- Keep handoffs objective: include next step and success criteria.
- Do not skip scope boundaries or non-goals in design and plan outputs.
- Enforce workflow gates from `docs/standards/github-workflow.md`:
  - issue and branch pre-check before file changes
  - mandatory subagent code review loop until `PASS`
  - compliance gate `PASS` before commit and push
  - PR target `dev`, assignee `philcoelho`, Copilot review loop processed

## Required Output Behavior

- Report checklist pass/fail status when finishing substantial tasks.
- Report compliance auditor result as strict `PASS` or `FAIL`.
- When blocked by missing inputs, ask concise clarifying questions instead of assuming.
- Prefer small, testable steps aligned with approved architecture and standards.
