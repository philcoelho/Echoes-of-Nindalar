# Compliance Gate (Mandatory)

Use `docs/standards/superpowers-compliance-checklist.md` as a required quality gate in this project.

- Before proposing implementation, verify checklist applicability and required artifacts.
- Before claiming completion, explicitly validate the 10 checklist items.
- If any mandatory item fails, stop and fix the gap before proceeding.
- Keep handoffs objective: include next step and success criteria.
- Do not skip scope boundaries or non-goals in design and plan outputs.

## Required Output Behavior

- Report checklist pass/fail status when finishing substantial tasks.
- When blocked by missing inputs, ask concise clarifying questions instead of assuming.
- Prefer small, testable steps aligned with approved architecture and standards.
