# Documentation Standards Enforcement

When creating or editing files under `docs/**/*.md`, follow:

- `docs/standards/doc-template.md`
- `docs/standards/devlog.md`
- `docs/standards/github-workflow.md`
- `docs/standards/superpowers-compliance-checklist.md`

## Mandatory Rules

- Include valid YAML frontmatter for standard documents and plans.
- Keep headings clear, concise, and structurally consistent.
- Use short paragraphs and bullet lists; avoid tables, emojis, and decorative formatting.
- Explicitly define goals and non-goals for design and planning docs.
- Keep invariants and critical rules visible when relevant.
- For issue and PR process content, require GitHub MCP conventions from `github-workflow.md`.

## Devlog-Specific Rules

- Devlog entries must follow the naming and frontmatter contract in `devlog.md`.
- Include motivation and concrete changes, not only chronology.
- Keep commit references complete before finalizing entries.
