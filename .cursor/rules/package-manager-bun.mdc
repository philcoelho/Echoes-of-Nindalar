# Bun Package Manager Rule

- Use Bun as the default package manager for all setup, dependency, and script commands.
- Prefer:
  - `bun install` instead of `npm install` or `pnpm install`
  - `bun run <script>` instead of `npm run <script>`
  - `bunx <tool>` for one-off CLI execution when applicable
- Treat `bun.lock` as the lockfile source of truth.
- Do not introduce npm or pnpm commands in project documentation, plans, or implementation unless explicitly requested.
