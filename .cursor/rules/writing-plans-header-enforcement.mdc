# Writing-Plans Header Enforcement

For implementation plan files generated or updated with Superpowers workflows:

- Keep the mandatory block exactly in the document:
  - `# <Feature Name> Implementation Plan`
  - `> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.`
  - `**Goal:** ...`
  - `**Architecture:** ...`
  - `**Tech Stack:** ...`
- Do not remove this block during normalization to project documentation standards.
- If formatting updates are needed, apply them around this mandatory header block.
- If the block is missing in a plan file, restore it before handoff.
